8 species whole-genome alignments were produced to quantify coding potential of genes

Methods were as performed previously, except CC-4532 v6 or CC-503 v6 assemblies replaced CC-503 v5 assembly

Pipeline is documented in: https://github.com/rorycraig337/Chlamydomonas_comparative_genomics/tree/master/Cactus_WGA
