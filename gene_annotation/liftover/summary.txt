##Analysis 3: missing gene pipeline

#potential missing genes can come from three sources

	1) from genes present in v4 but missing in v5 (provided by Ian Blaby)
	2) from genes identified by Craig et al. (2020) using the v5 genome, several of which are novel polycistronic
	3) from genes present in v5 that may be absent in v6.1e CC-503 or v1.1 CC-4532
	4) from genes present in CC-503 v6.1e but absent in CC-4532 v1.1, or vice versa

#all sets were stringently filtered on TE overlap and coding potential (requiring an algal homolog, functional domain or phyloCSF score >=100)
#this was to avoid adding in "missing genes" that were in fact false positives all along
#set 4 genes took priority over other sets in case of redundancy
#Mating type R domain genes were not inclded in analyses

#to identify putative missing genes a Cactus whole-genome alignment was produced between CC-503 v4, CC-503 v5, CC-503 v6 and CC-4532 v1
#CDS coordinates for a given candidate gene were then lifted over between the relevant assemblies (e.g. CC-503 v4 -> v6)
#if the liftover was near-complete (>90% bases) and the lifted coordinates had minimal (<10%) overlap with CDS in the existing annotation it was considered putatively missing
#analyses were performed after filtering the CC-503 v6.1e and CC-4532 v1.1 annotaitons for TE genes and low quality genes
