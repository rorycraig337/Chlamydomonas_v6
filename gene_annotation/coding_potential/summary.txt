##Analysis 2: low quality / low coding potential  pipeline

#genes were first split into two datasets, either: control (at least one homolog in other algal species and/or protein domain) or test (neither a homolog or domain)
#all analyses were performed on the primary transcript of each gene
#test set were then scored on four metrics of coding potential:

	1) PhyloCSF in 8-species whole-genome alignment (C. reinhardtii, C. incerta, C. schloesseri, E. debaryana, G. pectorale, Y. unicocca, Eudorina spp., V. carteri)
	   This score represent coding potential based on the alignment of the predicted CDS, genuine CDS should have high synonymous and low nonsynonymous divergence
	   The more positive the score the more likely coding, the more negative the more likely noncoding
	   The score was taken as the highest scoring CDS exon for a given a gene
	   As a liberal filter any test set genes with a score <1 were deemed to fail this test

	2) Ratio of genetic diversity (pi) at zero-fold and four-fold degenerate sites, calculated from 17 C. reinhardtii field isolations from Quebec
	   We expect most genuine genes to have higher diversity and synonymous (i.e. 4D sites) than at nonsynonymous (i.e. 0D), and for the ration to be <<1
	   Test set genes were deemed to fail if they had pi_OD/4D > 95th percentile of the control set (CC-503 = 0.7466381, CC-4532 = 0.7451584)

	3) Synonymous codon usage as quantified by the index of translation elongation (ITE), which is conceptually similar to the codon adaptation index (CAI)
	   We would expect genuine CDS to be within the range of codon usage of control set genes, while false positive genes would have more random codon usage
 	   Test set genes were deemed to fail if they had ITE < 5th percentie of control set (CC-503 = 0.575610, CC-4532 = 0.5763925)

	4) Kozak sequence score, following Cross (2015)
	   A consensus Kozak sequence logo was made from a random half of the control set genes
	   A score was ten calculated per test gene based on the match in bits between the test gene start codon context and the consensus Kozak sequence
	   A test gene failed with a Kozak score <0.25, this is the weakest filter as a) the distribution of control and test do overlap, and b) it requires the gene to have the correct start codon

#based on the above a test set gene was deemed to be low quality and a likely false positive if it failed PhyloCSF + at least 2/3 of the additional tests
#based on filter above mean number of exons was 1.4 (CC-503 & CC-4532), mean ORF length (minus repetitive sequence) was 416 bp (CC-503) / 422 bp (CC-4532)
#to avoid over filtering genes were also retained if they had 3 or more exons and/or an ORF length (minus any repetitive sequence) >=900 bp
#total count was 1435 (CC-503) and and 1417 (CC-4532) low quality genes
