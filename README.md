# Chlamydomonas_v6
Personal code associated with the version 6 update of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii reference genome

The wider project was a collaboration between several researchers. Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation was performed in collaboration with JGI and general details are provided on Phytozome: https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/CreinhardtiiCC_4532_v6_1

## Directories:

**assembly_scaffolding**: scaffolding pipeline for preliminary CC-4532 and CC-503 PacBio contigs

**repeat_annotation**: repeat annotation pipeline

**gene_annotation**: post-processing of preliminary gene models (coding potential, TE genes, etc.)

**MUM&CO**: pipeline for structural mutation detection

**Cactus_WGA**: whole-genome alignment pipeline

**H3K4me3_validation**: pipeline for gene model validation via H3K4me3
